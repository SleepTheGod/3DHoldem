<title>3D Holdem</title>

<h1>3D Holdem</h1>

<p>3D Holdem is a type of Poker with great depth of strategy and resistance to computer analysis.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>As in Texas Holdem all players get two hole cards of their own which only they can see
and there are four rounds of betting with community cards dealt out between them.
Community cards are dealt out in three rows, which first get three cards each on the flop,
then one more each on the turn, and finally one last card to each row on the river. In the end
there are fifteen community cards on the table, three rows with five each.
A player's hand is the best 5-card poker hand which can be made
using their two hole cards plus one community card from each row.</p>

<p>Unlike in other poker variants, in 3D Holdem a flush beats a full house (see
statistics below for why). All other hand rankings are the same.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>In this example, your hole cards are:</p>

<p>J♡ 4♡</p>

<p>You can potentially make a flush but not a
straight because both of your hole cards must be in your final hand.</p>

<p>The flop comes down like this:</p>

<p>
A♢ 5♣ J♣<br>
2♡ A♠ K♢<br>
7♡ Q♡ A♣</p>

<p>Now your best hand is A♢ from the first row, A♠ from the second row, and A♣ from the
third row giving you three aces with a jack and four kicker. You don't make a full
house (aces over jacks) because your hand must include your 4♡. You also don't make a flush because
even though there are three hearts on the board two of them are on the same row and
you have to take exactly one card from each row. You're behind anything
including the other ace, which makes four aces, any pocket pair, which makes a
full house, and any queen or king, which makes three aces with a higher kicker.</p>

<p>Here is the turn:</p>

<p>A♢ 5♣ J♣ 8♡<br>
2♡ A♠ K♢ 8♣<br>
7♡ Q♡ A♣ J♢</p>

<p>Your hand has improved to a flush using the 8♡, 2♡ and Q♡. Since in 3D Holdem
flushes beat full houses you now beat a pocket pair.</p>

<p>Finally the river:</p>

<p>A♢ 5♣ J♣ 8♡ A♡<br>
2♡ A♠ K♢ 8♣ J♠<br>
7♡ Q♡ A♣ J♢ K♣</p>

<p>Now you've made four jacks and because all four aces are on the board you know
that nobody can beat you with four aces. But pocket kings will beat
you with four kings.</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>

<p>3D Holdem has fast play and simple rules like its close relatives Texas Holdem
and Omaha. It has a much wider variety of situations which can arise because more cards
are dealt out and some of them can act as blockers, which gives it greater strategic depth.
Players being stuck with both of their hole cards creates more
potential for reads. The larger number of hands also makes it much more difficult
for computers to analyze.</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>

<p>3D Holdem was inspired by 5 Card Omaha and first posted about
<a href="https://twitter.com/bramcohen/status/1212468802291687426">here</a>.
The property that flush should beat full house was discovered while putting this page together.</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>

<p>Going from Omaha to 5CO gets less increased resistance to brute force than you might expect.
It goes up by a factor of less than 100, while 3DH beats it by over 100 million.</p>

<p>In 3D Holdem flush beats full house because it has lower
probability. This happens because of the pigeonhole principle,
which applies more to full house than flush, but the details are complex and
the chances were fairly close to begin with.</p>

<p>In the Omahas it looks like three of a kind is less likely than a straight but that's
misleading. A full house is upgraded but still a three of a kind. Vanilla three of a kind plus
full house is greater than straight. In Texas Hold'em pair beats high card for the same reason.</p>

<p>Also in the Omahas
two pair is particularly likely because there's often a pair on the board and one
in the hole cards because the birthday paradox applies to both. Pairs act sort of like higher high cards.</p>

<p>Lots of hands hit a draw on the river in both 5 Card Omaha and 3D Holdem</p>
